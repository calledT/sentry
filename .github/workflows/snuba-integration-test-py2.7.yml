      # If we make these jobs "required" to merge on GH, then on every PR, GitHub automatically
      # creates a status check in the "pending" state. This means that the workflow needs to run
      # for every PR in order to update the status checks.
      #
      # In order to optimize CI usage, we want the tests to only run when python files change,
      # since frontend changes should have no effect on these test suites. We cannot use GH workflow
      # path filters because entire workflow would be skipped vs skipping individual jobs which
      # would still allow this status check to pass.
